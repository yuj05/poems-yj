<br>They come in waves,
<br>my feelings for you.
<br>And not pretty whitecaps
<br>dancing at my feet.
<br>But when I least expect it.
<br>When life seems to be
<br>a quiet stream of continuity.
<br>They come to disrupt.
<br>So forceful they pull me under,
<br>so that I am drowning and once again,
<br>canâ€™t catch my breath.
