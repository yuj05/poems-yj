<br>It came upon the midnight clear,
<br>That glorious song of old,
<br>From angels bending near the earth
<br>To touch their harps of gold:
<br>"Peace on the earth, good will to men
<br>From heav'n's all-gracious King."
<br>The world in solemn stillness lay
<br>To hear the angels sing.
<br>
<br>Still thru the cloven skies they come
<br>With peaceful wings unfurled,
<br>And still their heav'nly music floats
<br>O'er all the weary world.
<br>Above its sad and lowly plains
<br>They bend on hov'ring wing,
<br>And ever o'er its babel sounds
<br>The blessed angels sing.
<br>
<br>For lo! the days are hast'ning on,
<br>By prophets seen of old,
<br>When with the ever-circling years
<br>Shall come the time foretold,
<br>When the new heav'n and earth shall own
<br>The Prince of Peace their King,
<br>And the whole world send back the song
<br>Which now the angels sing.
