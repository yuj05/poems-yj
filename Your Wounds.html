<br>Time doesn’t heal wounds

<br>
<br>It doesn’t heal wounds to
<br>erase the memories.
<br>
<br>Time leaves you with a scar
<br>to remind you of how you fought through it.
<br>
<br>Time leaves you with a scar
<br>to remind you of how you bled
<br>
<br>and how you survived.
<br>
<br>You survived.
